This excel project repository contains multiple excel projects where I have used different types of excel functions to achive the end result.
Here are some of the excel functions I have used in these projects: IF, IFelse, OR, Text to columns, vlookup, pivot tables, conditional formtating, concatenate, left, mid, right, importing data from text file to excel.
Charts: Bar chart, line chart, pie chart, adding slicer to the dashboard.
